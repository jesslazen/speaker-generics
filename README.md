# speaker-generics
A reproducible analysis of how people interpret generic statements (“Birds fly”) depending on speaker knowledge. The repo includes deidentified data, cleaning scripts, modeling code, and the Quarto file used to generate my portfolio report. Showcases my workflow for experimental design, mixed-effects modeling, and transparent documentation.
